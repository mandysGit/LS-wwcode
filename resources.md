# Launch School WWCODE Resources 
WWCODE is a casual way to connect with other people from under-represented genders (women and non-binary folks) in the LS community and talk about programming and mastery-based learning; as well as share experiences, challenges, tips, and more! Women and enby students in Prep or any LS course are welcome to attend.
